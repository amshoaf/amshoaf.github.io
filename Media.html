                <h2 style="margin-left: 8em;">VR From Past to Present</h2>
                <p">Over the years, virtual reality has gone from being just a concept with similar properties as a panoramic</p> 
                <p>painting to what we know today. Virtual reality is utilized in many new media forms. As our society continues</p>
                <p>to advance, virtual reality will replace most current usages of media.</p>

                <p>Virtual reality is a unique way to view video games, television shows, and movies. This will further allow</p> 
                <p>important life moments to be captured as if you are there in real time. With VR, there is a unique 360° view.</p>

                <p>This technology has formed part of experimental sound displays and sound installations. Another use is virtual</p>
                <p>reality musical instruments where the person can interact with these instruments as a new type of performance.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-left: 10em;">VR in film and TV</h2>
                <p>Virtual reality has been featured in several film and television programs. It is often used to illustrate the</p> 
                <p>concept of being trapped within the machine (i.e, cyberspace), or as a form of advanced technology.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-left: 12.5em;">VR Art</h2>
                <p>There are artists who use virtual reality to explore certain ideas or concepts. They create a three dimensional</p> 
                <p>environment as a form of communication with the audience. One example is the work of Kenneth Rinaldo</p>
                <p>who uses robotics and augmented reality to explore ideas related to the human-technology boundary.</p>

                <p>Jang Ji-sung, who lost her daughter to blood cancer in 2016, welcomed the opportunity to see her daughter</p>
                <p>again—even if it was just in VR. Jang may not have been the first mother to lose a child, but she is perhaps</p>
                <p>the first who got to meet her deceased daughter as a VR simulation, one that took almost a year to create.</p>
